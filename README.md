This is my rendition of the Weather Dashboard! Upon opening the site the user is presented with the current weather for Atlanta,GA and the option to search any city in the US.
When the city name is typed in and the 'Look Up' button is clicked the User's search is stored in a 'recent search' box and made clickable to be revisted later. When the page is refreshed the recent searches are still available with an option to clear them from local storage and off screen. Every search returns a current and five day forecast.
